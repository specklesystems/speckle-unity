## Introduction

This repo holds Speckle's Unity Connector + a sample project (Speckle playground). This connector is currently in an Alpha stage.

This connector is meant to be used by developers, it doesn't have an elaborated UI but it offers convenience methods to send and receive data. The connector uses our [Speckle .NET SDK](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-sharp).

Features:
 - Recieve Speckle Objects at Editor or Runtime
 - Send Speckle Objects at Runtime (editor support in the works!)
 - Material override/subsitution
 - Automatic receiving changes
 
Currently tested on Windows and MacOS. Experimental support for Android [in the works](https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-unity/issues/68).


## Installation
